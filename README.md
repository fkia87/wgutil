# wgutil
A utility for installing wireguard and managing its users and interfaces.

## How to use:

* Clone project using this command: 

    `git clone <github-url>`

* Then run `wgutil --help` to see the manual.

Note that "Wireguard" requires a name server to be installed on server to work properly. This script does not install or manage that.
