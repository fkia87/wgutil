# wgutil
A utility for installing wireguard, creating and removing users and interfaces.

## Requirements
- qrencode

## How to use:

* Clone project using this command: 

    `git clone --recurse-submodules <github-url>`

* Then run `wgutil --help` to see the manual.

Note that "Wireguard" requires a name server to be installed and configured on server to work properly. This script does not install or manage that.
